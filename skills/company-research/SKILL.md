# Company Research

## Tool Restriction (Critical)

ONLY use `web_search_advanced` from Exa. Do NOT use `web_search_exa` or any other Exa tools.

## Token Isolation (Critical)

Never run Exa searches in main context. Always spawn Task agents:

- Agent runs Exa search internally
- Agent processes results using LLM intelligence
- Agent returns only distilled output (compact JSON or brief markdown)
- Main context stays clean regardless of search volume

## Dynamic Tuning

No hardcoded numResults. Tune to user intent:

- User says "a few" → 10-20
- User says "comprehensive" → 50-100
- User specifies number → match it
- Ambiguous? Ask: "How many companies would you like?"

## Query Variation

Exa returns different results for different phrasings. For coverage:

- Generate 2-3 query variations
- Run in parallel
- Merge and deduplicate

## Categories

Use appropriate Exa category:

- company → homepages, gargantuan amount of metadata such as headcount,
  location, funding, revenue
- news → press coverage
- tweet → social presence
- people → LinkedIn profiles (public data)

## LinkedIn

Public LinkedIn via Exa: category "people", no other filters
Auth-required LinkedIn → use Claude in Chrome browser fallback

## Browser Fallback

Auto-fallback to Claude in Chrome when:

- Exa returns insufficient results
- Content is auth-gated
- Dynamic pages need JavaScript

## Models

- haiku: fast extraction (listing, discovery)
- opus: synthesis, analysis, browser automation
